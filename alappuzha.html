                          <p>
                            Referred to as the Venice of the East, Alappuzha has always enjoyed an important place in the maritime history of Kerala. Today, it is famous for its boat races, backwater holidays, beaches, marine products and coir industry. Alappuzha Beach is a popular picnic spot. The pier, which extends out to the sea here, is over 137 years old. Entertainment facilities at the Vijaya Beach Park add to the attraction of the beach. There is also an old lighthouse nearby which greatly intrigues all visitors.

                            <br> Another delightful experience while in Alappuzha is the houseboat cruise. The houseboats you find in the backwaters of Alappuzha are in fact a reworked version of the Kettuvallams of olden times. Kettuvallam is a Malayalam word, ‘Kettu’, refers to dwelling structures and ‘Vallom’ means boat. In the olden days, kettuvallam or boat with thatched roof that covers over wooden hulls was used to carry tons of rice and spices. 

                            <br>  Of late, houseboats come equipped with all the comforts of a good hotel room including furnished bedrooms, modern toilets, cozy living rooms, a kitchen and even a balcony for angling. An uninterrupted view of life in the backwaters can be enjoyed while staying in a houseboat.

                                  An oasis of fun and frolic right by the side of a vast green-blue expanse, that is how the famed Alappuzha beach welcomes you. The palm-fringed beach, surrounded by lush greenery and historic structures, is a magical combination that serenades you into a land of wonders.

As the swells of the ocean crash onto the shores and you listen to the gentle whispers of the cool breeze and the rhythmic song of the ocean, get ready to be transported to a tranquil space.

One of the most popular picnic spots in Alappuzha, this beach is famous for an ancient pier and a lighthouse. The pier is over 140 years old and breathes history.  Built by Captain Crawford, this structure gives you a rare experience of walking right into the sea! The old lighthouse here is another fascinating feature that draws people to the beach.

Be it lazing away on the golden sands and finding your moment of quietude, enjoying a sunbath or indulging in countless entertainment activities, Alappuzha Beach has all this and more to satiate the lotus-eater in you.

The Vijaya Beach Park on the beach is a picnic spot that is tailor-made for children. Facilities for boating, riding on a toy train and bicycles are also available here.

The most interesting time to be here is during the New Year bash when the beach bursts with festive fervour. The Sand Art Fest and the Beach fest are events to watch out for. Once here, also keep your ears cocked for sagas and songs that recount the glorious role the district played in the maritime history of Kerala.
